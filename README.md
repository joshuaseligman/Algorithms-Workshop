# Algorithms-Workshop

This repository contains the workshop I presented for Marist College Computer Society. The objective of the workshop was to teach our members a few basic data structures algorithms, and techniques to make them more comfortable with questions asked in coding interviews and tests. The workshop was completed using Java, but feel free to use another programming language to solve and understand the problems.

To get started, begin by installing Java.

The Java JDK can be found at the following link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/


Once Java is installed, proceed to the `workshop.md` file for all the instructions and explanations behind the solutions for 3 coding questions.
